Pose2Sim
========

.. note:: Please set undistort_points and handle_LR_swap to false for now since it currently leads to inaccuracies. I'll try to fix it soon.

.. note:: **News: Version 0.8:**

   - **Automatic camera synchronization is now supported!**
   - **Other recently added features**: Multi-person analysis, Blender visualization, Marker augmentation, Automatic batch processing.

To upgrade, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pose2sim --upgrade

Pose2Sim provides a workflow for 3D markerless kinematics, as an alternative to the more usual marker-based motion capture methods. It aims to provide a free tool to obtain research-grade results from consumer-grade equipment. Any combination of phone, webcam, GoPro, etc. can be used.

Pose2Sim stands for "OpenPose to OpenSim", as it uses OpenPose inputs (2D keypoints coordinates obtained from multiple videos) and leads to an OpenSim result (full-body 3D joint angles). Other 2D pose estimators such as BlazePose (MediaPipe), DeepLabCut, AlphaPose, can now be used as inputs.

If you can only use one single camera and don't mind losing some accuracy, please consider using `Sports2D <https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D>`_.
